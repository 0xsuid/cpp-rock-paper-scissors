# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project implements a simple command-line version of the classic rock-paper-scissors game in C++, using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles 

## Features

- Implements game logic using classes and objects in C++
- Allows the player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors
- Randomly generates the opponent's choice
- Determines the winner based on the game rules
- Provides an animated ASCII art display during gameplay

## Object-Oriented Design

The game leverages OOP concepts with the following classes:

- **Player**: Manages user input and choice selection
- **Opponent**: Generates random choices for the opponent
- **Result**: Stores game outcomes
- **RockPaperScissors**: Orchestrates the game flow, input/output, and game logic
